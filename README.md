Machine Learning to Predict Rainfall in Bangladesh

I am trying to get more parameters to feed into these algorithms. Currently, I am only using past years rainfall data but rainfall also depends on many other parameters like humidity, temperature, perticipitation, etc. New features will be Date, Station, Humidity, Percitipitation. So, if I can manage those data, I will use them too in our project to increase the precision.
